	Long: `Ballot is a distributed leader election tool built on Consul.

It uses Consul's session and KV store APIs to perform leader election
among service instances. When a service becomes leader, it is tagged
with a configurable primary tag and optional hooks can be executed.

Features:
  - Consul session-based leader election
  - Automatic primary tag management
  - Configurable promotion/demotion hooks
  - Health check aware leadership`,
